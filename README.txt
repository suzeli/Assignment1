Assignment1
===========

This is required for assignment 1


I am Eliot Friedman.  I have been working as a government contractor/programmer/software 
engineer here in Maryland for the last 22 years.  Ruby on Rails has been showing up with
increasing frequency in project requirements, so I thought it would be good to learn it.
